07_class_decorators.py
=======================
Demonstrates class decorators:
  - A class decorator that adds metadata to a class
  - A class decorator that adds a method to a class
  - When class decorators are useful vs. when inheritance is better
  - The difference between a class decorator and a metaclass (brief note)

# PART 1: Class decorator that adds metadata
#
# A class decorator is just a callable that receives a CLASS and returns a CLASS.
# It follows exactly the same pattern as a function decorator:
#
#   @register_component(kind="extractor")
#   class S3Extractor: ...
#
# is equivalent to:
#   S3Extractor = register_component(kind="extractor")(S3Extractor)
#
# Flow:
#   1. register_component("extractor") is called → returns `decorator`
#   2. decorator(S3Extractor) is called → stamps cls.component_kind = "extractor"
#   3. decorator returns cls unchanged (same class object, now with extra attrs)
#   4. S3Extractor still works exactly as before — no inheritance needed.
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

def register_component(kind: str):
    """Decorator factory: stamps a class with a component kind label.

    Returns a decorator that adds `component_kind` and `component_name`
    as class attributes. The class itself is returned unchanged — no
    wrapping, no new type, just attribute mutation.
    """

# PART 2: Class decorator that adds a method
#
# A decorator can also INJECT a new method into the class.
# Flow for @add_describe:

#   2. add_describe(RunSummary) is called.

#
# Class decorators fire at CLASS-DEFINITION TIME, not at instantiation.

# Flow for @require_docstring:

  Use a class decorator when:
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  • You want to add metadata, a method, or a label
    to classes that don't share a common base.
  • You want to apply a cross-cutting concern
    (logging, registration, validation) without coupling.
  • The added behaviour is orthogonal to the class's
    domain responsibility.

  Use inheritance when:
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  • The classes share a genuine IS-A relationship.
  • Subclasses need to override behaviour, not just
    receive it.
  • You want the base class to enforce an interface
    (combine with ABC for that).

  A class decorator modifies a class from the outside.
  Inheritance builds a new type from the inside.
