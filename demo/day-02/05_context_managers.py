=======================
Demonstrates deterministic resource cleanup using context managers:
  - Class-based: __enter__ and __exit__
  - Function-based: contextlib.contextmanager
  - How __exit__ is called even when an exception is raised
  - Suppressing exceptions inside __exit__

# PART 1: Class-based context manager
#
# How the `with` statement works:
#
#   with SomeContextManager() as x:
#       <body>
#
#   1. Python calls SomeContextManager().__enter__().
#      The return value is bound to `x`.
#   2. The <body> executes.
#   3. Python calls __exit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb) unconditionally —
#      whether the body finished normally OR raised an exception.
#      exc_type is None if no exception occurred.
#   4. If __exit__ returns True, any exception is suppressed.
#      If it returns False (or None), the exception propagates.
#
# The guarantee: __exit__ ALWAYS runs — equivalent to a try/finally block,
# but expressed as a reusable, composable object.
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

class ManagedConnection:
    """Simulates a database connection that must always be closed.

    __enter__: acquire the resource, return self (binds to the `as` variable).
    __exit__ : release the resource. The three parameters describe any exception
               that occurred in the body (all None if no exception).

    Returning False from __exit__ lets exceptions propagate normally.
    Returning True from __exit__ suppresses the exception (see PART 3).

# PART 2: Function-based context manager with @contextmanager
#
# @contextmanager turns a generator function into a context manager.

#
#   Code BEFORE yield  ←→ equivalent to __enter__
#   The `yield` expression  ←→ the value bound by `as`
#   Code AFTER yield (in finally) ←→ equivalent to __exit__
#
# Use a try/finally around the yield to guarantee cleanup even on exception.
# This is more compact than writing a full class for simple cases.
